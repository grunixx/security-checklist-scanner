# 🔍 Security Checklist Scanner

A lightweight CLI tool that performs basic security checks on a project directory, helping developers quickly identify common security risks during early development stages.

This project is intentionally simple, readable, and extensible — designed both as a practical tool and as a learning-focused showcase for security-oriented tooling.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Many security issues appear very early in software projects:

- Secrets accidentally committed to the repository  
- Missing or incomplete `.gitignore` files  
- Sensitive files tracked by version control  

Most existing security tools are powerful but heavy, complex, or difficult to customize.  
This project focuses on **early, low-friction security awareness**, especially for small projects, students, and prototypes.

## ✅ The Solution

**Security Checklist Scanner** scans a target directory and runs a set of modular security checks, producing a clear and readable CLI report with:

- Individual check results  
- Per-check severity levels  
- A calculated global severity  

The tool is designed to be:

- Easy to understand  
- Easy to extend  
- Safe to run locally

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user runs the CLI pointing to a project directory  
2. Each security check scans the project independently  
3. Results are normalized into a common format  
4. A global severity level is calculated  
5. Results are printed in a human-friendly CLI output (or JSON)

Each check exposes a `run(project_path: Path)` function and returns a structured result.

## 🔎 Implemented Checks

### 🔐 Secrets Check (`secrets_check`)

Scans source files for **possible hardcoded secrets**, such as:

- API keys  
- Tokens  
- Passwords  

**Features:**

- Regex-based detection  
- Severity classification (low / medium / high)  
- Ignores common directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, `venv`, etc.)

**Example output:**

• secrets_check
status: ok
severity: low
message: No hardcoded secrets detected


---

### 📁 Gitignore Check (`gitignore_check`)

Validates whether the project `.gitignore` includes common sensitive patterns, such as:

- `.env`  
- `*.pem`  
- `*.key`  

If missing, the check raises a warning with **medium severity**.

**Example output:**

• gitignore_check
status: warning
severity: medium
message: .gitignore missing sensitive entries: .env, *.env, *.pem

## ▶️ How to Run

From inside the `scanner` directory:

python -m scanner.main ..
JSON output
python -m scanner.main .. --json
🚦 Exit Codes
0 → no high severity issues detected

1 → high severity issues detected

## 🧭 Roadmap
Planned improvements:

Dependency vulnerability checks

File permission analysis

Configurable severity thresholds

Custom rule definitions

CI/CD integration examples

## 🎯 Project Goals
This project is both:

A practical security utility

A portfolio-quality demonstration of clean Python architecture, CLI design, and security-focused thinking
